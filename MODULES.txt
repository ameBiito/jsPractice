· MODULES

    · MODULES, INTRODUCTION - As an application grows bigger, we may want to split it into multiple files, so called "modules". A Module may contain a class, a library
      or functions for specific purposes.
        · "export" and "import" -> These are keywords used to interchange functionality between modules:
            - "export" -> Labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module
            - "import" -> Allows the import functionality from other modules
                    //sayHi.js (file)
                    export function sayHi(user){
                        alert(`Hi ${user}`);
                    }
                    //main.js (another file)
                    import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';
                    sayHi('John'); // Hi John
                · If used in an HTML file, when declaring them as a script you need to specify they're modules:
                        <script type="module">
                            import {sayHi} from `./sayHi.js;
                            document.body.innerHTML = sayHi('John');
                        </script>
                    · Modules can't run locally, either a static or live server have to be used.
        · CORE MODULE FEATURES - Modules are different from regular scripts:
            - They ALWAYS "use strict"
            - Each Module has its own scope (\"_"/)
            - A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported -> If the same module is imported into multiple other modules,
              its code is executed only once, upon the first import. This has consequences:
            - If executing a module brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times, will trigger it only once:
                    //alert.js
                    alert("Module is evaluated");
                    //1.js
                    import `alert.js`; // Module is evaluated
                    //2.js
                    import `alert.js`; // (shows nothing)
                · Top-level modules should be usd for initializaiton, creation of module-specific internal data structures. If we need to make something callbale multiple times, we should export it as a function.
            - This applies to other things, such as object creation:
                    //admin.js
                    export let admin = {
                        name: "John"
                    };
                    //1.js
                    import {admin} from './admin.js';
                    admin.name = "Pete";
                    //2.js
                    import {admin} from './admin.js';
                    alert(admin.name); // Pete 
                · Now every file that imports that object shares the same object because the object is only created once and then the other files get a reference to the same thing.
                · This behaviour can be useful because it allows to configure multiple modules using only an object
            - "import.meta" -> The object "import.meta" contains the information about the current module.(its content vary on the environment)
            - In a Module "this" is undefined 
        · BROWSER SPECIFIC FEATURES - There are also browser-specific differences of scripts with 'type="module"': 
            - Module scripts are deferred -> Theay are ALWAYS deferred (same effect as defer) for both external and inline scripts.
              As a side effect, module scripts always "see" the fully loaded HTML-page including elements below them(regular scripts can't because they execute immediatly)
            - Async works on inline scripts - For non-module scripts, the "async" attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediatly when ready,
              independently of other scripts or the HTML document. For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.
                    <script async type="module">
                        import{counter} from './analytics.js';
                        counter.count();
                    </script>
            - External Scripts -> External scripts that are type="module" are different in 2 aspects:
                1. External scripts with the same "src" run only once:
                        <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
                        <script type="module" src="my.js"></script> <!--The script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
                2. External scripts from another orgin(e.g another site) require CORS headers(headers that allow access from another origin) to ensure security
            - No "bare" methods are allowed -> In the browser, "import" must have either a relative or absoulte URL, Modules without one are called "bare":
                    import {sayHi} from 'sayhi.js'; //error in browser, not in nodejs
            
    · EXPORT AND IMPORT 
        · EXPORT BEFORE DECLARATIONS - We can label any declaration as exported placing an "export" before it, be it a variable, a function or a class
        · EXPORT APART FROM DECLARATIONS - We can put "export" separately, that is, first declaring and then exporting:
                //say.js
                function sayHi(user){
                    alert(`Hi ${user}`);
                }
                function sayBye(){
                    alert("Bye");
                }
                export {sayHi, sayBye};
        · IMPORT* -> Usually, we put a list of things to import in curly braces "import{...}". We can however import everything as an object using import*:
                import * as say from '/say.js'; //imports everything from module and puts it in the object say
                say.sayHi("John"); //Hi John
            · You can import everything without thinking about performance since tools such as webpack will import only the stuff you actually use ignoring the unused ones.
        · IMPORT "as" - We can use "as" to import under different names:
                import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
                hi('John'); //Hi John
        · EXPORT "as" - Same thing as import "as" but it sets the official names for outsiders:
                export {sayHi as hi};
                //1.js
                import {hi} from './say.js'
        
        · EXPORT DEFAULT - When we have a file that exports only a single entity we may want to make it easier to import. We use "export default" (of which there can be 1 per file)
          to make that entity the defalut thing that gets exported and then imported:
                //user.js
                export default class User{
                    constructor(name){
                        this.name = name;4
                    }
                }
                //main.js
                import User from './user.js'; // note that the import doesn't use {}
                new User('John');
            · Since it is exported by defalut, the entity may have no name:
                    export default class{...} // no class name 
            · If we have a mix of default and named entities, we import them like this:
                    import {default as Name, namedEntity} from './';
                    // or if we import it as an object
                    import * as Name from './';
                    Name.default; // the default export
            · Since we can rename things that have been exported by default, it is not always a good idea to use it, especially in a large team 
        · RE-EXPORT - Allows us to import things and immediatly export them, possibly under another name. The syntax is "export...from".
          Basically is just a shorthand, instead of writing:
                import{login, logout} from './helpers';
                export {login, logout};
            You can write:
                export {login, logout} from './helpers';
            So that another user doesn't have to deal with the file structure or for security reasons.
            · Re-exported modules aren't available in the file where they are re-exported
            · The default export has its own handling when re-exported which is spaghetti when we have defalut and named entities:
                    export * from './user.js';         // to re-export named entities
                    export {default} from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export 
    
    · DYNAMIC IMPORTS - We can't generate any parameters of "import" since it's a static construct, nor we can import conditionally or at run-time.
        · THE "import()" EXPRESSION - The "import(module)" expression loads the module and returns a Promise that resolves into a module object that contains 
          all its exports. It can be called from any piece of code and can be called dynamically:
                let modulePath = prompt("Which module to load?");
                import(modulePath)
                    .then(obj => <moduleObject)
                    .catch(err => <loading error e.g if no such module>);
            · Or we could use "await"
                    let {hi, bye} = await import("./say.js");
                    hi();
                    bye();
            · Dynamic imports work in regular scripts, they don't need 'script type="module"'
            · Although "import()" looks like a function, it isn't. It's a special syntax just like super(), so we can't copy it to a variable nor we can use "call"/"apply" with it.
