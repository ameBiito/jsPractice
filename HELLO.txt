js programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an html docunent using the <script> tag:
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html>
    <body>
        <p>Before the script</p>

        <script>
            alert('Hello world!');
        </script>

        <p>After the script</p>
    </body>
    </html>


it is, however, better have a path to a script instead of the script itself:
    <script src = "pathToScript.js"></script>
