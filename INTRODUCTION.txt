javascript was created to make web pages alive

the programs created in this language are called scripts, they can be written in a web page html and run automatically when a page loads as they dont require special preparations to run

javascipt is an high level language and its capabilities greatly depend on the environment it is running in (node.js has different functions its in-browser implementations)

in-browser js can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user and the webserver, for example:
    ·add new html to the page changing the existinf content and modifying its style
    ·react to user actions
    ·send requests over the network to remove servers(upload and download)
    ·get, set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages
    ·remeber the data on the client's side(local storage)
there are however things taht in-browser js cannot do either because not possible or because recognized as an harmful behaviour(these do not apply to server-side js):
    ·it has no direct access to the OS, meaning, it cannor read, write arbitrary files nor execute programs(thing taht can be bypassed through html actions such as <input>)
    ·different tabs/windows shouldn't now of each other, so, js cannot access the other page if they come from a different domain, protocol, port; to work around that, both pages must agree for a data exchange
    ·js can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from, so, this ability is crippled except for special cases(HTTP/HTTPS)

js is useful because it has: full integration with HTML/CSS, it's simple and it is supported by all major browsers by default
