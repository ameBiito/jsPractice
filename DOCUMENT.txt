· DOCUMENT 

    · BROWSER ENVIRONMENT, SPECS - Everything that can run js is called a "host environment" either be it a browser, server, ... .
      A host environment provides its own objects and functions in additions to the language core.
        · DOM(DOCUMENT MODEL OBJECT) - The DOM represents all the page content as objects that can be modified.
          The "document" object is the main entry point to the page, we change or create anything regarding the page using it:
                document.body.style.background = "red"; //changes background color to red 
                setTimeout(() => document.body.style.background = "", 1000 ) // changes it back after 1 sec
            · DOM can be used for server-side scripts as well (not only browsers)
            · CSSOM is used together with DOM to modify CSS rules from js
        · BOM(BROWSER OBJECT MODEL) - The BOM represents additional objects provided by the host environment for working with everything except the document. For instance:
            - The "navigator" object provides background information about the browser and the os
            - The "location" object allows us to read the current URL and can redirect the browser to a new one. For example:
                    alert(location.href); //shows current URL 
                    if(confirm("Go to Wikipedia?")){
                        location.href = "https://wikipedia.org";
                    }
    
    · DOM TREE - The backbone of an HTML document is tags. According to DOM, every tag is an object. These objects are accessible using js and through them we can 
      modify a page. For example, document.body is an object reprenting the <body> tag:
            document.body.syle.background = 'red'; // the background of body is now red colored
        · Tags are "element nodes" and they form a tree structure.
        · The text inside the elements forms "text nodes" labelled as #text. Text nodes may only contain a string, they are always the leaf of a tree and thus cannot have children
        · AUTOCORRECTION - If the browser encouters a malfourmed HTML, it corrects it automatically when making the DOM. For instance, the top tag is always
          <html>, even if it doesn't exisat in the document, it will exist in the DOM because the browser will create it, same thing for <body>.
          Same thing for unclosed tags. Also, even though you can omit it when writing the document, tables must have the <tbody> tag, it is thus added automatically.
        · Comments are a node type and they're labelled as #comment as well as <!DOCTYPE...> . Everything inside an HTML document is part of DOM.
        · There are 12 node types but in practice we usually work with 4 of them:
          - "document" -> The entry point into DOM 
          - "element nodes" -> HTML-tags, the tree building blocks
          - "text nodes" -> Contain text
          - "comments" 

    · WALKING THE DOM - All operations on the DOM start with the "document" object throgh which we can reach every element.
        · "documentELement" AND "body" - The topmos document node is "document.documentELement", that's the dome of the <html> tag.
